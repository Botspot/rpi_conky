# rpi_conky

Improved version of Novaspirit's conky script. Newer versions of Conky won't play the old configs due to syntax errors, so this script has been corrected.  
Also, I (Botspot) have improved the colors, as the original colors did not look very good together. Screenshot below:

## To Install:

    sudo apt install -y conky
    wget -O ~/.conkyrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Botspot/rpi_conky/master/conkyrc

## To uninstall:

    sudo apt purge -y conky
    rm ~/.conkyrc

### Note about the network readout:
By default, this conky configuration will assume the active network interface is `eth0`. If you are using WiFi, this needs changing before the network readout will work. In my Pi-Apps installation script, the `.conkyrc` file is edited if WiFi is detected.  
The commands used to accomplish this is provided below, for your convenience:
```
#change eth0 to wlan0 in conky config if user is currently using WiFi
interface="$(ip addr | awk '/state UP/ {print $2}' | tr -d ':' | head -n 1)"
if [ ! -z "$interface" ];then
  sed -i "s/eth0/$interface/g" ~/.conkyrc
fi
```
I suppose if you installed conky manually, you can run the above code in your terminal. (Or you could just edit the `.conkyrc` file.)
